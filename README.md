## Introduction ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I'm Grant, an IT student @USU. This is my competitive programming journey. I'll document every competitive programming i do and learn, then built my portfolio based of it. This is different from my other Data Structure and Algorithm repository, because this repos only contain every competition i compete in and also materials im learning.
