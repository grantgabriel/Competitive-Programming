# ðŸš€ Competitive Programming CPP

This is my template for competitive programming, using C++ language. A lot of the redefining function is useful for a lot of practice, i personally use it in Google KickStart, and also a numerous competitive programming competition!

I personally want to update this CP template to make it a lot more complete, with more library that i built from scratch, and more. So keep checking for any other update, thank you ^3^)/ ~
